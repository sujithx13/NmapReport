NMAP INTRODUCTON:
	Nmap is the powerful and widely usage open-source tool used for scanning network.
It helps to find out which devices are active,  what ports are open and what services are 
running on those ports.It is the most comman tool used in cyber security and ethical hacking.In
Nmap we can check our network security and can able to identify the unknown devices and detect the 
vurnabilities.
	There are different types of scan command each command perform the specific operation - like checking
the open port , services , detecting the operating system.
	In this project, I used various nmap commmands to findout the,
	
	* Which devices are active 
	* Which ports are open
	* Which service are running 
	* And what possible risk are there.

NMAP SCAN COMMANDS:

	2) sudo nmap -sV <target ip> ( used to find out the version )
	3) sudo nmap -sS <target ip> ( used to find out the service which are running in the target ip )
